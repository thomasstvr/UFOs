# UFOs
In this project we built a webpage which showcases a table of UFO sightings an allows users to filter those sightings bases on location, date, and the shape of the UFO. JavaScript has been employed to build the site and Data-Driven Documents are used to filter the table.

## Results
The webpage is clean and well laid out although the table is very large and therefor cumbersome to navigate. The contents of the table can be filtered by entering date, city, state, country, and shape. Not all of these parameters must be entered, you could filter on any combination you desire.
