# UFOs
In this project we built a webpage which showcases a table of UFO sightings an allows users to filter those sightings bases on location, date, and the shape of the UFO. JavaScript has been employed to build the site and Data-Driven Documents are used to filter the table.

## Results
The webpage is clean and well laid out although the table is very large and therefor cumbersome to navigate. The contents of the table can be filtered by entering date, city, state, country, and shape. Not all of these parameters must be entered, you could filter on any combination you desire.

## Summary
One draw back to this page is the use (or lack thereof) of capitalization. The table data is in all lowercase (with some exceptions in the comments column). When searching for a state or city, all lowercase must be used in order for the search to return the desired results. This is something that should be addressed. Correct use of capitalization or not, the search filters should return the desired results.

Another filter that should be added is Duration. With the current webpage, users cannot filter based on length of sighting which could be a valuable parameter. In order to accomplish this the Duration column would have to be made uniform in units or the filter be made to accommodate all types of entry.
